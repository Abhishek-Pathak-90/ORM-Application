# ORM Application (Orbit Response Matrix Analyzer)

This **PyQt5** application analyzes orbit response matrices (ORM) from accelerator data. It is designed to load time-domain signals of **BPMs** (Beam Position Monitors) and **corrector magnets**, compute FFT-based spectra, build orbit response matrices, and propagate measurement errors‚Äîall within a dark-themed GUI.

## Features
- **Dark-Themed PyQt5 GUI**  
  A modern dark UI with multiple tabs for **Correctors**, **BPMs**, **Response Matrices**, and **Error Matrices**.

- **Device Management**  
  Load lists of corrector and BPM devices from text files.

- **CSV Data Import**  
  Open a CSV file containing time-domain signal data; the app automatically identifies valid BPM & corrector columns.

- **Plots**  
  - Time-domain plots  
  - Frequency-domain (FFT) plots  
  - Heatmap of horizontal and vertical orbit response matrices  
  - Error matrix heatmaps  

- **Data Tables**  
  - Corrector parameters (peak-to-peak, dominant frequency, etc.)  
  - BPM measurement errors  
  - Response matrices and their error tables  

- **Save & Export**  
  - Export tables as CSV  
  - Save plots as PNG/JPG  

- **Excluded BPMs**  
  BPM channels that read zeros for all samples are excluded from analysis and listed in a special tab.

- **Adjustable Plot Fonts**  
  Easily control plot font size via a spin box at the bottom.

## Project Structure
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                    # Entry point to launch the application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mpl_canvas.py             # Contains the MplCanvas class for embedding Matplotlib
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ response_analyzer_app.py   # PyQt5 application with all tabs, UI, and logic

- **`main.py`**  
  Minimal entry script. It creates a `QApplication` instance and initializes the main window (`ResponseAnalyzerApp`).

- **`mpl_canvas.py`**  
  A small utility class (`MplCanvas`) that sets up a Matplotlib Figure and Axes within a PyQt widget.

- **`response_analyzer_app.py`**  
  Contains the main `ResponseAnalyzerApp` class, which extends `QMainWindow`.  
  Builds the tabs: **Correctors**, **BPMs**, **Response Matrix**, **Errors**, **Excluded BPMs**.  
  Handles file loading, data parsing, plotting, and analysis logic.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/orm-application.git
   cd orm-application
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**  
   The app requires Python 3.7+, PyQt5, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas:
   ```bash
   pip install pyqt5 matplotlib numpy pandas
   ```
   Or from a conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda install pyqt numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**  
   Check that the packages are installed correctly by running `pip list` or `conda list`.

## Usage

### Run the Application
```bash
python main.py
```
This will launch the GUI window.

### Load Device Lists (optional)
1. Go to `File ‚Üí Load Device Lists (Txt)` and select corrector and BPM text files.
2. Each file should have one device name per line.

### Open CSV Data
1. Go to `File ‚Üí Open CSV` to load a time-series data file.
2. The application expects columns like `CorrectorName(R)` and `BPMName(R)` (though it's configurable in the code).

### Analyze
As soon as the CSV is loaded, the app automatically:
- Identifies valid BPM and corrector columns
- Populates the tables (corrector params, BPM lists)
- Builds the Response Matrices and Error Matrices

### Plot
- **Correctors Tab**: Time and Frequency sub-tabs. Select correctors in a list widget, then click Re-Plot Selected.
- **BPMs Tab**: Similarly for horizontal and vertical BPM signals.

### Save or Export
- Any table can be exported as CSV (e.g., `Save Corrector Parameters`, `Save Table (H)`)
- Plots can be saved as PNG or JPG

## How It Works

### Data Import
- The user loads a CSV file containing time-domain data
- Pandas reads the data into a DataFrame `self.df`

### Analysis
1. **Compute Errors**: For each corrector/BPM signal, the dominant frequency is located via `np.argmax(FFT)`. Residual amplitude is used to compute RMS error.
2. **Build Response Matrix**: For each BPM and corrector pair, find the BPM amplitude at the corrector's dominant frequency. `R_ij = (BPM amplitude) / (corrector amplitude)`.
3. **Error Propagation**: The error matrix is computed using the partial derivative approach for each `R_ij`.

### Plotting
- **Time Domain**: Plain line plots vs. sample index
- **Frequency Domain**: FFT amplitude vs. frequency bin
- **Heatmaps**: `imshow` used to display 2D response/error matrices

---

## Customization
- Modify `response_analyzer_app.py` to add new tabs or widgets, tweak error calculations, or adjust how BPM/corrector files are read
- The styling is based on a dark Fusion theme. You can adjust it in the `_setDarkTheme()` method
- Plot Font: A spinbox in the status bar controls plot text size. See `_applyPlotFont()`
